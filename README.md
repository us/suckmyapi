# SuckMyAPI: Max Out Your API Limits (For Fun and Chaos!)

Ever wish you could see just how far an API can go before it throws in the towel? Or maybe you're tired of clients who conveniently forget to pay up. Say hello to **SuckMyAPI**—the most fun (and responsible) way to stress-test APIs like **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and more. Push them to their limits and watch the madness unfold, but be prepared for your wallet to scream for mercy!

## 🎭 Welcome to API Chaos!

Curious what happens when an API hits its breaking point? **SuckMyAPI** is here to let you find out in the most chaotic way possible. Whether it's sending massive token streams to **ChatGPT** or making **Claude** sweat, SuckMyAPI will show you how far these APIs can be pushed—right up to the edge of their limits.

---

## 🤔 What’s SuckMyAPI?

SuckMyAPI is a devilishly fun tool that pushes top APIs like **OpenAI’s GPT-4** and **Anthropic’s Claude** to the max. With tokens flying, CPUs overheating, and rate limits hit like never before, SuckMyAPI is the ultimate playground for **LLM**, **API**, and **rate limit** explorers. The question is: **How far can you push?**

---

## 🔥 APIs You Can Wreak Havoc On

Currently, we support the following powerhouses:

1. **OpenAI** – See how many tokens you can send before ChatGPT waves the white flag.
2. **Anthropic** – Push Claude to its limit and see how it handles the overload.

### Want More?  
We’re always open to adding more APIs! Got a favorite API that needs testing? Submit a pull request, and let’s turn it into a stress-testing party.

## 🎢 Features to Max Out APIs (And Your Budget)

**SuckMyAPI** cranks API usage to the limit by pushing every endpoint and firing async requests at full speed.

### 1. **Token Tsunami**
Flood APIs like **OpenAI’s GPT-4** and **Anthropic’s Claude** with maximum tokens until they can’t handle more.

### 2. **Limit Limbo**
Max out API rate limits by sending simultaneous async requests across all endpoints—completions, edits, embeddings, and more.

### 3. **Bill Buster 3000**
Push API billing models to the edge, watching costs rack up in real-time with each token and request.

### 4. **Endpoint Explorer**
Test **every** available endpoint at full capacity, ensuring a complete API stress test across all functions.
**How It Works:**

- **Async Requests**: SuckMyAPI uses asynchronous programming to make API requests. This means we can send a barrage of calls to every endpoint—**simultaneously**—maxing out API limits faster than you can blink.
  
- **Maxing out Per-Minute Limits**: Each API typically allows a set number of requests per minute. SuckMyAPI tests those limits by firing as many requests as possible in the shortest amount of time.
  
- **Endpoint Variety**: Why stop at one endpoint? We hit them all. Want to overload **OpenAI’s Completions** while simultaneously flooding **Embeddings** and **Moderations**? Done. Want to hit **Claude’s dialogue generation** and summarization at the same time? Easy.

The result? A **full-throttle stress test** that shows you exactly how far your favorite APIs can go before they break—or you run out of credits!

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **💸 Bill Shock Alert**: Yes, it’s fun, but expect some **serious billing damage**. Prepare your wallet for impact.
2. **🔥 Meltdown Incoming**: If your servers (or the API provider’s) start smoking, well, don’t say we didn’t warn you.
3. **👮 Use Responsibly**: With great power comes great *"Oh no, what have I done?"* moments. Please don’t overdo it.

## 🚀 How to Run the Madness

Once you’re ready to dive into the chaos, simply run:

```
python suck.py
```

You’ll be asked to choose between OpenAI and Anthropic:

```
Choose an option:
1. OpenAI
2. Anthropic
3. Both 😈
Enter the number of your choice: 
```

Pick your poison—**1** for OpenAI, **2** for Anthropic, or **3** for Both—and let the stress-testing begin!
